            We are honored to invite you to "Taboo," an exclusive art exhibition showcasing the powerful paintings of Jon Caraveo. This exhibit presents a deeply evocative exploration of the male youth form, where each piece conveys raw emotion and movement through striking silhouettes. Caraveo's work transcends the ordinary, engaging with themes of self-expression, vulnerability, and the human condition, set against profound, minimalist backgrounds that evoke a sense of introspection and narrative depth.

            The exhibition will be held on February 14, 2026, a significant date coinciding with both the artist's birthday and Valentine's Dayâ€”a celebration of love, life, and the transformative power of art. This event is open to the public but will be an intimate affair, with only 24 shared table seats available to ensure a personal and immersive experience with the work and its creator. Due to limited seating, we encourage you to RSVP to secure your place.
